A userscript for the Aladin viewer on the Simbad website.

We astrophotographers might use the Simbad database and the Aladin viewer to identify obscure little patches of light in our relatively deep photos. Objects that are deeper than the most obvious plate solving and visualising softwares go.

The website has all the functionality to locate an object under the mouse and show it, but these functionalities are not linked. I wrote this simple userscript to make use of the otherwise unused right click, to trigger a location search and display the list of objects under the mouse.
